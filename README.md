# @jsweb/jsdb

Simple embedded JSON database for modern Node.js applications.

## Install

```
npm i -S @jsweb/jsdb

# or

yarn add @jsweb/jsdb
```

## Usage

```javascript
import JSDB from '@jsweb/jsdb'

const db = new JSDB('base', 'path', 'dir') // or just base/path/dir

const posts = db.store('posts') // a JSON store into db
```

You don't need to create paths or files, **@jsweb/jsdb** will do the trick for you.

The base path directory is relative to de process root directory. It will be automatically detected using `process.cwd()`.

## JSON files

All your data will be stored in JSON files. The root object in the JSON are an Array and expects to store Objects. Like this:

```javascript
[
  { id: '...', name: 'John Doug', age: 28 },
  { id: '...', name: 'Jane Doug', age: 26 },
  { id: '...', name: 'Lorem Ipsum', age: 75 }
]
```

These objects are NoSQL like documents. So, no fixed model is required, they can be completely diferent.

It is just it, simple and vanilla JSON.

And if do you already have a JSON file full of data, just drop it into de database directory. It just works.

## Auto ID

`id` fields will be auto generated for each entry.

Here we have an immutable rule: `id` is only generated by **@jsweb/jsdb** and it is not possible to overwrite it, even if you provide one.

The only way you can edit `id` is editting the JSON file directly.

If you need to look at your data by indexing the value provided by yourself, just include a key/value into the Object.

**@jsweb/jsdb** have simple methods to `find` and `filter` your data by any field or rule.

## Auto optimization

**@jsweb/jsdb** checks `NODE_ENV` enviroment variable to optimize JSON files into db.

If you are running in `production` mode, then JSON will be minimized. Else it will be indented to develop, test or debug.
